                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>The experiment focuses on understanding heat transfer
                                and cooling properties of liquid nitrogen, crucial
                                for efficient storage and transfer of cryogenic
                                propellants in space missions. By immersing aluminum
                                cylinders into liquid nitrogen, the project aims to
                                investigate boiling characteristics, cool-down time,
                                and heat transfer dynamics. The experiment
                                addresses uncertainties identified in previous studies
                                by analyzing temperature gradients and heat transfer 
                                measurements, aiming to improve accuracy and reduce 
                                loss in propulsion systems. Utilizing insights from 
                                a NASA report, the project plans to benchmark data 
                                and specifically study aluminum cylinders to enhance 
                                understanding of cryogenic substances. By measuring 
                                temperature gradients and employing the heat transfer 
                                equation, the experiment seeks to provide more accurate 
                                analysis of cylinder quenching and contribute to the 
                                development of cryogenic storage and transfer systems. 
                                Quantitative data on heat transfer will be obtained, 
                                with measurements in watts or joules per second, and 
                                area in square meters.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Theory / Analysis</h2>
                            <p>This section delves into the analysis of heat transfer 
                                dynamics and the cooling process of aluminum cylinders 
                                submerged in liquid nitrogen. The analysis begins with 
                                establishing initial temperatures and calculating the 
                                Biot number to determine convective heat transfer's 
                                significant influence on cylinder temperature. Utilizing 
                                equations and data from sources like "Heat Transfer: 
                                A Practical Approach" by Yunus A. Cengel, the analysis 
                                computes the cool-down time of the cylinder to be 
                                approximately 6.5 minutes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Moreover, the discussion explores heat conduction and 
                                convective heat transfer equations to understand cooling 
                                dynamics. Thermal properties such as mass, volume, density, 
                                and specific heat capacity of the aluminum cylinder are 
                                considered. The thermal diffusivity of the material is 
                                defined and plays a crucial role in determining temperature 
                                changes over time. Theoretical predictions based on heat 
                                transfer equations will be compared with experimental 
                                data to validate the setup's accuracy and refine 
                                understanding of cooling dynamics.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Design of Testing Cylinders</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The focus was on creating an effective yet practical design for testing cylinders. The design needed to provide necessary data for hypothesis evaluation while being feasible for manufacturing.</li>
                                <li>Two cylinders were designed: Cylinder 1 served as the baseline measurement, while Cylinder 2 measured the heat flux of liquid nitrogen. Thermocouples were inserted into specific points for temperature measurement.</li>
                                <li>Precise drilling of holes for thermocouple insertion was crucial. Soft jawed clamps and mills were used for accuracy. Cylinder 1 required one hole, while Cylinder 2 needed two holes for thermocouple placement.</li>
                                <li>The project timeline was divided into design, manufacturing, testing, and analysis phases. Challenges arose in cool-down time calculations, sourcing materials, and unexpected difficulties in manufacturing. Member-specific roles and a detailed budget were outlined, with a focus on conservation due to budget constraints.</li>
                                <li>Overall, meticulous planning and adaptation were essential to overcome challenges and execute the project within the allotted timeframe and budget.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Appendix D: Assembly Plan</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Securing mounting wires to the ends of the cylinder using hose clamps, ensuring the cylinder hangs horizontally from a support beam.</li>
                                <li>Placing the support beam across the top of the dewar with the cylinder inside, ensuring proper clearance for submerging the cylinder in liquid nitrogen.</li>
                                <li>Calibrating the thermocouples using known temperature values such as the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77K) and the freezing point of purified water (273K).</li>
                                <li>Inserting the calibrated thermocouples into the 1/16" holes in the cylinders, wrapping PTFE tape around the thermocouple probe lead, and gently inserting the thermocouple into the hole with a twisting motion to ensure a snug fit without leakage.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Testing Objectives</h2>
                            <p>Cryogenic Boiling Team 1, also known as Charlie, aims 
                                to enhance understanding of heat transfer and cooling 
                                properties of liquid nitrogen by measuring temperature 
                                gradients of individual spheres using thermocouples at 
                                various points on the same plane along the radius. The 
                                objective is crucial for improving storage and transfer
                                of cryogenic propellants like hydrogen and oxygen, 
                                especially for long-term space travel where propellant 
                                loss due to boiling can be significant.
                            </p>
                            <p>To achieve this objective, the team plans to address 
                                inconsistency caused by the nitrogen vapor envelope 
                                surrounding the cylinder. They aim to measure temperature 
                                within the same plane of the cylinder's surface and 
                                compare results across different runs to reduce uncertainty 
                                in boiling data. Additionally, they intend to measure 
                                varying temperature gradients throughout the sphere to 
                                improve precision.
                            </p>
                            <p>The team will use the heat transfer equation, which 
                                measures heat transfer using thermal conductivity 
                                and temperature gradients, to analyze the data. 
                                They hope to provide improved uncertainty analysis 
                                of sphere quenching in cryogenic storage and transfer 
                                systems for long-term space missions.
                            </p>
                            <p>To prepare for the experiment, the team will reference 
                                a published report by NASA, which compiles studies 
                                from the past 70 years on heat flux during quenching. 
                                They will use average results from this paper as 
                                guidelines and conduct experiments with Type T 
                                thermocouples calibrated to the freezing point of water 
                                and the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Measurements 
                                will be taken at different points across the diameter of 
                                the sphere, and data will be collected and compared across 
                                different orientations and tests.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Testing</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Testing involved immersing aluminum cylinders into liquid nitrogen-filled dewars and measuring temperature changes using thermocouples. Cylinder 1 monitored temperature change at the center for baseline measurement, while Cylinder 2 measured temperature at the center and halfway to the surface along the radius.</li>
                                <li>Key measurements included temperature gradient and cool-down time. Temperature gradient determined heat flux through the cylinder using equation 1, while cool-down time measured the time for the cylinder to reach 2% of liquid nitrogen temperature (77K).</li>
                                <li>Constraints included liquid nitrogen temperature, cylinder dimensions, and dewar size. Room temperature and liquid nitrogen depth were recorded, ensuring accurate results. Initial liquid nitrogen volume should be 10 liters, maintaining a depth of about 12 inches in the dewar.</li>
                                <li>Variables included the number of holes drilled in the cylinder. Cylinder 1 had one hole to the center, while Cylinder 2 had two holes and was tested three times. Detailed procedures and parameters are outlined in Appendix E and F, respectively.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Results and Discussions</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The experiment aimed to understand heat transfer and boiling in cryogenic fluids, with results detailed in Appendices C.D and C.I. Cool down times were measured, with Cylinder 1 showing an average of 382 seconds and Cylinder 2 at 310 seconds, 21% lower than expected.</li>
                                <li>Cylinder 1 had a center drilled hole, while Cylinder 2 had an additional hole halfway to the surface, providing insights into heat flux variations across the radius. Temperature gradients between the center and halfway point were analyzed, showing slightly colder temperatures at the outer part as expected.</li>
                                <li>Heat flux calculations, utilizing varying thermal conductivity, were plotted against NASA report data in Figure 6. While the team's data didn't precisely match, the recorded heat flux values were within the expected range, especially for temperature changes above 10 K.</li>
                                <li>Challenges included equipment limitations due to budget constraints and maintenance issues with the Data Acquisition Kit, affecting accuracy, particularly for short temperature change periods. However, over longer periods, experimental readings aligned more closely with theoretical expectations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The project aimed to enhance understanding of heat transfer and cooling properties of cryogenic substances, focusing on liquid nitrogen, for improving efficiency in storage and transfer systems of cryogenic propellants. Two aluminum cylinders were immersed in liquid nitrogen, measuring cool-down times and heat flux dynamics.</li>
                                <li>Cylinder 1, with a single measurement location, exhibited a cool-down time of 390 seconds, aligning with predictions. However, Cylinder 2, with two measurement points, showed a 21% lower cool-down time potentially due to surface disturbances from drilling.</li>
                                <li>The experimental heat flux data fell within expected ranges but did not precisely match published sources. Future work recommendations include repeating experiments with higher-budget equipment, testing multiple geometries and materials, and improving temperature-to-heat flux calculations.</li>
                                <li>A future project may involve testing different materials (aluminum, copper, steel) in both spherical and cylindrical geometries, with multiple measurement points for temperature analysis. Improved mounting setups and quicker warm-up methods could enhance test accuracy and efficiency, aiming for clearer comparisons with published data.</li>
