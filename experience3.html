            <ul>
                <li>C++ is a programming language commonly employed in various cutting-edge technologies like autonomous vehicles such as 
					fixed-wing aircraft, underwater gliders, and space launch vehicles. It's also used for creating robot arms, underwater 
					robots, and other autonomous systems, leveraging expertise in embedded systems. Additionally, tools like Blender, Python, 
					and C++ are utilized for designing these robot arms and underwater robots to meet specific goals. Researchers also delve
					 into studying animals like birds, bats, fish, and insects to learn from their precise sensing abilities in ever-changing 
					 environments, offering valuable insights for advancing technology.

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Past Work: Fiducial Markers</h2>
            <p>AprilTag is a type of fiducial marker, a specific collection of 2D barcodes. When placed on a known object, observation of the markers can be used to calculate relative distance and orientation of the object.</p>
            <p>AprilTag accuracies were tested with several variables to predict spacecraft applicability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Surface curvature affects the accuracy of AprilTag detection.</li>
                <li>- The distance from the camera impacts the precision of AprilTag recognition.</li>
                <li>- The size of the AprilTag influences its detectability.</li>
                <li>- The orientation relative to the camera affects the reliability of AprilTag readings.</li>
                <li>- Shadow obfuscation can degrade the performance of AprilTag detection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Testbed & Robot Operating System (ROS)</h2>
            <h3 class="text-2xl text-pink">ROS: Background</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The control system will be bench-tested using 6DOF robotic manipulator arms to carry camera-equipped spacecraft models through simulated orbital trajectories.</li>
                <li>ROS, or Robot Operating System, is an open-source collection of software libraries which is being used to program the robotic arms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-2xl text-pink">ROS: Physical System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The objective is to set up a pair of robotic manipulators that can carry a camera (observer) and a spacecraft model 
					with AprilTags attached (target). The trajectory of the observer could then be controlled through a feedback loop 
					using data from the AprilTag-camera system.</li>
                <li>Over the last year, the adaptation of existing single-arm configurations to a dual-arm configuration has been under 
					development. This involves adapting existing Xacro/UDRF models for dual-arm, adapting launch files for dual-arm, and 
					visualization of the dual-arm system in RViz.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-2xl text-pink">ROS: Simulation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Before running physical tests, planned trajectories will be demonstrated in virtual simulations. This will help prevent unwanted collisions during testing. Motion planning tools interface with the ROS simulation platform, Gazebo.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Future Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3 class="text-2xl text-pink">Next Steps for Robot Programming</h3>
                <li>- Development of the Gazebo model.</li>
                <li>- Development of the inverse kinematics model (MoveIt).</li>
                <li>- Implementation of a feedback loop into robotic controls.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3 class="text-2xl text-pink">Improving AprilTag Characterization</h3>
                <li>To fully grasp the capabilities of AprilTags, we need to delve deeper into their accuracy through an expanded 
					preliminary study. This entails figuring out the right size of tags relative to distance for optimal performance 
					in various missions and considering the curvature of modern spacecraft fleets. Gathering ample data within these 
					parameters is crucial. Additionally, we aim to establish guidelines for placing AprilTags on spacecraft to ensure
					 precise motion tracking from every angle.

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Blender</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Blender experimentation involves utilizing the bpy (Blender Python) package.</li>
                <li>- A script is developed to rotate a Blender-made object and capture pictures at fixed intervals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Robotics with Python</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In robotics using Python, people usually create Python scripts to make the robot arms move in specific ways. 
					They start by trying out simple movements to understand how it all works. The main aim is to give the robot 
					precise instructions, like a mathematical formula describing a curve and where it should start and finish. 
					These instructions help generate a script that the arm follows to move exactly as desired.
