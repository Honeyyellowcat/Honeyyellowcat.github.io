When did the US’s need surpass its production?
when looking at the Production Need line and where it crosses the "Actual Production" linewe can see the seafood is no longer 
able to meet the consumption needs of the population.

What’s missing from the data we gave you that would help explain why the US was still able to consume more seafood than it produced?
The data doesn't include seafood imports, which could clarify why the US consumed more seafood than it produced. Import details would show 
the broader seafood supply and consumption trends. Also data on seafood stocks could explain how the US met consumption needs despite
low production.
