These questions are for Part 2 and assume that you've finished implementing and running analysis.py.

1. What happened to all the centroids? Why are there fewer than the 10 initial centroids?

Answer: One possibility for this could be that during the kmeans.py clustering process, some centroids 
might have ended up without any data points assigned to them. Another possibility could be that some 
centroids might have merged during the clustering process, and due to this, there could be fewer centroids overall.

2. What's the accuracy of the algorithm for the MNIST dataset? By looking at the
centroids, which digits are easier to be distinguished by the algorithm,
and which are harder?

Answer: To determine the accuracy of the algorithm for the dataset, we can run the accuracy function from 
kmeans.py. The accuracy would be the ratio of correctly classified data points to the total number of data 
points. We can ascertain which digits are easier or harder to distinguish by observing each digit class.
