            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>A group of venture capitalists expressed interest in funding a network of small satellites to 
                    provide satellite internet coverage globally. They tasked our team with designing a low-cost 
                    rocket featuring a reusable first stage capable of deploying a single 1,000 kg satellite into 
                    a 500 km altitude low-Earth orbit (LEO). Key design requirements included delivering the payload 
                    efficiently, minimizing costs, and ensuring reusability of the first stage.</p>

            <h2>Fuel Choice</h2>
                <p>Staged Combustion Liquid Rocket Motors (LMR) using Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) 
                    were chosen for both stages due to their cost-effectiveness and high specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>).</p>

            <h2>Turbomachinery</h2>
                <p>Turbopump masses and performance parameters were estimated for each stage to ensure efficient fuel 
                    delivery.</p>
  
            <h2>Combustion Chamber: Film Cooling</h2>
                <p>Film cooling techniques were employed to manage high combustion temperatures, with bell nozzle 
                    configurations adopted for optimal thrust.</p>

            <h2>Regenerative Cooling</h2>
                <p>Regenerative cooling techniques were implemented in the combustion chamber to efficiently dissipate 
                    heat and maintain structural integrity.</p>
  
            <h2>Rocket Overview</h2>
                <p>Detailed analysis was conducted on the rocket's dimensions, stage burnout breakdown, and total 
                    cost projections, with a focus on meeting payload delivery requirements while optimizing cost efficiency.</p>
