            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>A group of venture capitalists expressed interest in funding a network of small satellites to 
                    provide satellite internet coverage globally. They tasked our team with designing a low-cost 
                    rocket featuring a reusable first stage capable of deploying a single 1,000 kg satellite into 
                    a 500 km altitude low-Earth orbit (LEO). Key design requirements included delivering the payload 
                    efficiently, minimizing costs, and ensuring reusability of the first stage.</p>

        <h1>Abstract:</h1>
            <p>The NOVA 1 rocket, designed by Chief Engineers Felicity Cundiff, Grayson Atwell, Mack Rowan Howard, 
                Andrew Truong, Kai Alden Laslett-Vigil, and Daniel Molidor, was meticulously crafted to achieve a 
                specific mission objective. With the goal of delivering a 1000 kg payload to a 500 km Low Earth Orbit 
                (LEO), the rocket was engineered with a ∆V budget of 9 km/s. Pioneering cost-effectiveness, the NOVA 1 
                boasts a launch cost of $13.5 million per launch, demonstrating superior efficiency in achieving its 
                mission goals. The rocket's remarkable performance attributes include a launch mass of 15,266 kg, 
                generating a net ∆V of 9.175 km/s, with a burnout altitude of 545 km and a burn time of 439.6 seconds.</p>

        <h2>Introduction and Background:</h2>
            <p>The NOVA 1 rocket project was initiated in response to a challenge presented by venture capitalists, 
                demanding a cost-effective solution for deploying satellites into LEO. The project entails designing 
                a gas turbine engine core for airbreathing propulsion, emphasizing 
                performance optimization and maintaining acceptable turbine inlet temperatures. The compressor, 
                combustor, and turbine collectively influence engine efficiency and emissions. Design decisions 
                are justified based on efficiency, cost, and performance at the designated design point.</p>

        <h2>Technical Approach:</h2>
            <p>To ensure optimal performance and minimize propellant loss during launch and mission, the NOVA 1 
                employs a sophisticated cryogenic fuel storage system. Drawing inspiration from established practices 
                at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the rocket features double-walled vacuum storage tanks constructed 
                from stainless steel and carbon steel. These tanks house liquid hydrogen and oxygen, carefully 
                designed to mitigate boil-off and maintain propellant integrity throughout the mission.</p>
                
        <h2>Fuel Choice</h2>
            <p>Staged Combustion Liquid Rocket Motors (LMR) using Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) 
                were chosen for both stages due to their cost-effectiveness and high specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>).</p>      
     
        <h2>Cryogenic Fuel Storage:</h2>
            <p>A meticulous technical approach guided the NOVA 1 project, beginning with the crucial task of 
                selecting the most suitable propellant combination. Through exhaustive trade studies, liquid 
                hydrogen and oxygen emerged as the preferred choice due to their high specific impulse and 
                cost-effectiveness. Further optimization involved determining critical performance parameters 
                such as chamber pressure, mixing ratio, and expansion ratio, achieved through iterative analysis 
                utilizing NASA's CEA software.</p>

        <h2>Turbomachinery:</h2>
            <p>Integral to the rocket's propulsion system, turbomachinery plays a vital role in efficiently 
                delivering propellants to the combustion chamber. The turbopumps, meticulously sized and optimized, 
                exhibit mass values of 93.21 kg for the first stage and 38.42 kg for the second stage. Employing 
                staged combustion LRMs, the turbopumps contribute significantly to the rocket's overall performance, 
                ensuring precise fuel delivery and combustion efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Combustor - Film Cooling:</h2>
            <p>To withstand the extreme temperatures generated during combustion, the NOVA 1 features a robust 
                combustion chamber equipped with film cooling technology. This innovative solution, utilizing 
                gaseous film cooling, effectively manages temperatures to prevent structural degradation. By 
                circulating hydrogen along the chamber's inner wall, the system maintains temperatures within safe 
                limits, ensuring the chamber's structural integrity throughout the mission.</p>

        <h2>Regenerative Cooling</h2>
            <p>Regenerative cooling techniques were implemented in the combustion chamber to efficiently dissipate 
                heat and maintain structural integrity.</p>
  
              </ul>
            <section>
                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <p>Future work will involve further research and development, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Exploration of controlled reentry and landing capabilities for the first stage, utilizing excess ΔV to enhance reusability.</li>
                  <li>Optimization of the first stage design, including pressure matching to sea level conditions and implementation of stability control mechanisms such as fins or gimbling nozzles.</li>
                  <li>Structural analysis of the combustion chamber and storage tanks to determine optimal wall thickness for containing high pressures.</li>
                  <li>Exploring the use of passive cooling techniques in the nozzle design to reduce manufacturing and operational costs.</li>
                </ul>
