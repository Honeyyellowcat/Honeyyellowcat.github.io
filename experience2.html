            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Theory / Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- This section delves into the analysis of heat transfer dynamics and the cooling process of aluminum cylinders submerged in liquid nitrogen. The analysis begins with establishing initial temperatures and calculating the Biot number to determine convective heat transfer's significant influence on cylinder temperature. Utilizing equations and data from sources like "Heat Transfer: A Practical Approach" by Yunus A. Cengel, the analysis computes the cool-down time of the cylinder to be approximately 6.5 minutes.</li>
                <li>- Moreover, the discussion explores heat conduction and convective heat transfer equations to understand cooling dynamics. Thermal properties such as mass, volume, density, and specific heat capacity of the aluminum cylinder are considered. The thermal diffusivity of the material is defined and plays a crucial role in determining temperature changes over time. Theoretical predictions based on heat transfer equations will be compared with experimental data to validate the setup's accuracy and refine understanding of cooling dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Design of Testing Cylinders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- The focus was on creating an effective yet practical design for testing cylinders. The design needed to provide necessary data for hypothesis evaluation while being feasible for manufacturing.</li>
                <li>- Two cylinders were designed: Cylinder 1 served as the baseline measurement, while Cylinder 2 measured the heat flux of liquid nitrogen. Thermocouples were inserted into specific points for temperature measurement.</li>
                <li>- Precise drilling of holes for thermocouple insertion was crucial. Soft jawed clamps and mills were used for accuracy. Cylinder 1 required one hole, while Cylinder 2 needed two holes for thermocouple placement.</li>
                <li>- The project timeline was divided into design, manufacturing, testing, and analysis phases. Challenges arose in cool-down time calculations, sourcing materials, and unexpected difficulties in manufacturing. Member-specific roles and a detailed budget were outlined, with a focus on conservation due to budget constraints.</li>
                <li>- Overall, meticulous planning and adaptation were essential to overcome challenges and execute the project within the allotted timeframe and budget.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Testing Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryogenic Boiling Team 1, affectionately known as Charlie, is on a mission to deepen our understanding of how liquid nitrogen cools. 
                    By placing thermocouples at various points on the same plane along the radius of individual spheres, they aim to measure temperature 
                    gradients. This knowledge is vital for enhancing the storage and transfer of cryogenic propellants such as hydrogen and oxygen, 
                    especially for prolonged space missions where propellant loss due to boiling is a significant concern.
                </li>
                <li>To achieve their goal, Charlie's team is tackling the challenge of inconsistency caused by the nitrogen vapor envelope around 
                    the cylinder. They plan to measure temperatures within the cylinder's surface plane and compare results across different runs to
                     minimize uncertainty in boiling data. Additionally, they aim to assess temperature gradients throughout the sphere to enhance 
                     precision. Armed with these insights, they will employ the heat transfer equation to analyze the data, aiming to offer improved 
                     uncertainty analysis of sphere quenching in cryogenic storage and transfer systems, crucial for long-term space missions.
                </li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Testing</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> During testing, we dipped aluminum cylinders into containers filled with super cold liquid nitrogen and tracked temperature 
                        shifts using special sensors called thermocouples. Cylinder 1 focused on the temperature change at its core to establish a 
                        reference point, whereas Cylinder 2 measured temperatures both at its core and halfway to the surface, across its width.
                    </li>
                    <li> We kept an eye on two main factors: the temperature difference across the cylinder (known as temperature gradient) and how 
                        long it took for the cylinder to cool down to 2% of the liquid nitrogen's temperature (which is around 77 Kelvin). We had to 
                        consider various factors like the temperature of the liquid nitrogen, the size of the cylinders, and the containers they were 
                        in. To ensure precise results, we meticulously recorded the room temperature, the depth of the liquid nitrogen, and maintained 
                        a consistent initial volume of liquid nitrogen in the container. Additionally, we played around with variables like the number 
                        of holes in the cylinders; Cylinder 1 had one hole drilled to its core, while Cylinder 2 had two holes and underwent testing thrice.
                         You can find detailed step-by-step procedures and specific parameters in Appendices E and F for more insight.

                </ul>
        
                <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Results and Discussions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> In this experiment, we delved into how heat moves and liquids boil at super low temperatures. We examined two cylinders, each 
                        with a different setup. Cylinder 1 took about 382 seconds to cool down on average, while Cylinder 2 cooled in just 310 seconds, 
                        surprising us by being 21% faster than anticipated.
                    </li>
                    <li> The difference? Well, Cylinder 1 had a hole right in the middle, whereas Cylinder 2 had an extra hole halfway to the surface. 
                        This setup helped us peek into how heat spreads across these cylinders. We found that the outer parts were a bit colder than the
                        center, which was what we expected. Despite some challenges with our equipment and data accuracy, especially for quick temperature 
                        changes, our results generally lined up with what we predicted, especially when temperatures shifted by more than 10 degrees.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink">Conclusions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> The project focused on studying how substances like liquid nitrogen transfer heat and cool down, which is crucial for better 
                        handling of cryogenic propellants. By immersing aluminum cylinders in liquid nitrogen and measuring their cooling times and heat 
                        flow, researchers aimed to improve storage and transfer systems for these substances. One cylinder cooled down in 390 seconds, 
                        matching expectations, while another, with more measurement points, cooled down 21% faster, possibly due to surface irregularities.           </li>
                    <li> Although the experimental data generally aligned with predictions, there were discrepancies with published sources. Suggestions 
                        for future research include using better equipment, testing various shapes and materials, and refining temperature-to-heat flux
                        calculations. Another proposed project involves testing different materials and shapes with improved measurement techniques to 
                        enhance accuracy and efficiency, ultimately aiming for clearer comparisons with existing data.
