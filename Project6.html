            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>A group of venture capitalists expressed interest in funding a network of small satellites to 
                    provide satellite internet coverage globally. They tasked our team with designing a low-cost 
                    rocket featuring a reusable first stage capable of deploying a single 1,000 kg satellite into 
                    a 500 km altitude low-Earth orbit (LEO). Key design requirements included delivering the payload 
                    efficiently, minimizing costs, and ensuring reusability of the first stage.</p>

            <h1>Abstract:</h1>
                <p>The NOVA 1 rocket, designed by Chief Engineers Felicity Cundiff, Grayson Atwell, Mack Rowan Howard, 
                    Andrew Truong, Kai Alden Laslett-Vigil, and Daniel Molidor, was meticulously crafted to achieve a 
                    specific mission objective. With the goal of delivering a 1000 kg payload to a 500 km Low Earth Orbit 
                    (LEO), the rocket was engineered with a ∆V budget of 9 km/s. Pioneering cost-effectiveness, the NOVA 1 
                    boasts a launch cost of $13.5 million per launch, demonstrating superior efficiency in achieving its 
                    mission goals. The rocket's remarkable performance attributes include a launch mass of 15,266 kg, 
                    generating a net ∆V of 9.175 km/s, with a burnout altitude of 545 km and a burn time of 439.6 seconds.</p>

            <h2>Introduction and Background:</h2>
                <p>The NOVA 1 rocket project was initiated in response to a challenge presented by venture capitalists, 
                    demanding a cost-effective solution for deploying satellites into LEO. The project entails designing 
                    a gas turbine engine core for airbreathing propulsion, emphasizing 
                    performance optimization and maintaining acceptable turbine inlet temperatures. The compressor, 
                    combustor, and turbine collectively influence engine efficiency and emissions. Design decisions 
                    are justified based on efficiency, cost, and performance at the designated design point.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach:</h2>
                <p>To ensure optimal performance and minimize propellant loss during launch and mission, the NOVA 1 
                    employs a sophisticated cryogenic fuel storage system. Drawing inspiration from established practices 
                    at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the rocket features double-walled vacuum storage tanks constructed 
                    from stainless steel and carbon steel. These tanks house liquid hydrogen and oxygen, carefully 
                    designed to mitigate boil-off and maintain propellant integrity throughout the mission.</p>

            <h2>Cryogenic Fuel Storage:</h2>
                <p>A meticulous technical approach guided the NOVA 1 project, beginning with the crucial task of 
                    selecting the most suitable propellant combination. Through exhaustive trade studies, liquid 
                    hydrogen and oxygen emerged as the preferred choice due to their high specific impulse and 
                    cost-effectiveness. Further optimization involved determining critical performance parameters 
                    such as chamber pressure, mixing ratio, and expansion ratio, achieved through iterative analysis 
                    utilizing NASA's CEA software.</p>

            <h2>Turbomachinery:</h2>
                <p>Integral to the rocket's propulsion system, turbomachinery plays a vital role in efficiently 
                    delivering propellants to the combustion chamber. The turbopumps, meticulously sized and optimized, 
                    exhibit mass values of 93.21 kg for the first stage and 38.42 kg for the second stage. Employing 
                    staged combustion LRMs, the turbopumps contribute significantly to the rocket's overall performance, 
                    ensuring precise fuel delivery and combustion efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Combustor - Film Cooling:</h2>
                <p>To withstand the extreme temperatures generated during combustion, the NOVA 1 features a robust 
                    combustion chamber equipped with film cooling technology. This innovative solution, utilizing 
                    gaseous film cooling, effectively manages temperatures to prevent structural degradation. By 
                    circulating hydrogen along the chamber's inner wall, the system maintains temperatures within safe 
                    limits, ensuring the chamber's structural integrity throughout the mission.</p>

            <h2>Compressor:</h2>
                <p>In the compressor design section, maximizing total compressor ratio while considering exit 
                    temperature and efficiency is crucial. Parameters like solidity, inlet angle, and number of 
                    stages significantly impact pressure and temperature behaviors. Analysis justifications involve 
                    equations for total efficiency, specific work, outlet temperature, and pressure.</p>

            <h2>Turbine:</h2>
                <p>Efficient operation, cost minimization, and compressor-turbine matching are focal points in 
                    turbine design. Plots illustrate pressure, temperature, efficiency, work output, and mass flow 
                    rate across turbine stages. Considerations include work output, turbine efficiency, and mass 
                    flow rate calculations to ensure optimal turbine performance.</p>

            <h2>Aeroengine Design Project Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>The project provides insights into gas turbine engine core design and analysis, addressing 
                    specific requirements and constraints. Leveraging analytical tools and thorough evaluations, 
                    the project aims to enhance engine efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
